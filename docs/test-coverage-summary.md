### 4. ✅ CredentialsStepProcessor (14 test cases) ⚡ [ENHANCED]

Tests Sonatype credentials configuration (username/password).

**Existing Test Cases:**
- Auto-detection from environment variables
- User rejection of auto-detected credentials
- Manual input when no auto-detection found
- Required username validation
- Global gradle.properties detection

**New Test Cases Added:**
- Step progress indicator verification (Step 3 of 6)
- Password masking in confirmation prompts

- Global properties file with missing username
- Global properties file with missing password
- Global properties file with empty values
- User rejecting global properties auto-detection

**Key Coverage:**
- Multi-source credential detection
- Security masking of sensitive data
- File system interaction edge cases
- User choice handling flows
- Configuration precedence logic

### 5. ✅ SigningStepProcessor (16 test cases) ⚡ [ENHANCED]

Tests GPG signing configuration (key ID/private key and password).

**Existing Test Cases:**
- Auto-detection from environment variables
- User rejection of auto-detected signing
- Manual input when no auto-detection found
- Required signing key validation
- Global gradle.properties detection
- Key masking in confirmation prompts

**New Test Cases Added:**
- Step progress indicator verification (Step 4 of 6)
- Short key masking (≤8 chars) - complete masking
- Long key masking (>8 chars) - first 4 + asterisks + last 4
- Environment variables precedence over global properties
- Empty password validation (allowed for signing)
- Manual input message when user rejects auto-detection
- Different message when no auto-detection found
- Missing global gradle.properties file handling
- Global properties file with missing signing key
- Global properties file with missing signing password
- Global properties file with empty values
- User rejecting global properties auto-detection

**Key Coverage:**
- Advanced key masking algorithms
- Multi-source signing detection
- File system edge cases
- Security best practices
- User experience flows

### 6. ✅ ProjectInfoStepProcessor (Existing)

Tests project metadata configuration (name, description, developers, etc.).

**Test Cases:**
- Auto-detected vs manual project information
- Individual field confirmation and editing
- Developer information handling
- Validation for required fields
- Git repository information integration

**Key Coverage:**
- Project metadata handling
- Git integration
- Developer information management
- Field validation logic

## 🔧 Testing Methodology

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)
All new test cases were implemented following strict TDD principles:
1. **Red**: Write failing tests for uncovered scenarios
2. **Green**: Implement minimal code to make tests pass
3. **Refactor**: Improve code quality while maintaining test coverage

### Mock Strategy
- **PromptSystem**: Mocked for all user interactions
- **Environment Variables**: Stubbed using system-stubs-jupiter
- **File System**: Real file operations with proper cleanup
- **Context**: Builder pattern for test data consistency

### Coverage Targets
- **Line Coverage**: >98% for all step processors
- **Branch Coverage**: >95% for complex conditional logic
- **Edge Case Coverage**: All error paths and boundary conditions
- **User Flow Coverage**: Both happy path and error scenarios

## 📝 Test Naming Conventions

All test methods follow descriptive naming with backticks:
```kotlin
@Test
fun `should auto-detect environment variables and ask user if they want to use them`()

@Test
fun `should handle global properties file with missing username`()

@Test
fun `should mask long keys with first and last 4 characters visible`()
```

## 🛡️ Security Testing

Special attention to security-related functionality:
- **Credential Masking**: Passwords shown as asterisks in UI
- **Key Masking**: GPG keys partially masked (first 4 + asterisks + last 4)
- **No Credential Logging**: Sensitive data never logged or exposed
- **Secure Defaults**: Safe fallbacks for all configuration scenarios

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

### Potential Additional Test Scenarios
1. **Performance Tests**: Large configuration file handling
2. **Integration Tests**: End-to-end wizard flow testing
3. **Accessibility Tests**: Screen reader compatibility
4. **Internationalization**: Multi-language support testing

### Coverage Monitoring
- Automated coverage reporting via Kover
- Codecov integration for pull request validation
- Minimum coverage thresholds enforced in CI/CD
