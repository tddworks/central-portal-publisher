# Central Portal Publisher Refactoring Initiative

## Overview

This directory contains the complete refactoring plan for the Central Portal Publisher Gradle plugin. The goal is to dramatically reduce the cognitive load and learning curve for developers using this plugin.

## Documents

1. **[PRD.md](./PRD.md)** - Product Requirements Document
   - Problem statement and pain points
   - Goals and success metrics  
   - Solution overview with key features
   - Technical architecture
   - Implementation phases

2. **[user-stories.md](./user-stories.md)** - User Stories
   - 7 epics covering all aspects of the refactoring
   - 21 detailed user stories with acceptance criteria
   - Priority matrix for implementation order

3. **[implementation-tasks.md](./implementation-tasks.md)** - Implementation Tasks
   - 40+ specific technical tasks
   - Time estimates and dependencies
   - 6 implementation phases
   - Critical path and quick wins identified

## Key Goals

### Before → After

| Aspect | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Setup Time** | 2-4 hours | < 5 minutes |
| **Configuration Lines** | 20+ | < 5 |
| **Task Names** | `publishAggregationPublicationsToSonatypePortalRepository` | `publishToCentral` |
| **Error Messages** | Technical, unclear | Actionable with fixes |
| **Learning Curve** | Steep, requires Maven knowledge | Gentle, progressive |

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
- Configuration layer refactoring
- Auto-detection framework
- Validation system

### Phase 2: Simplification (Weeks 3-4)
- New intuitive DSL
- Simplified task names
- Smart defaults

### Phase 3: Developer Experience (Weeks 5-6)
- Interactive setup wizard
- Actionable error messages
- Progress indicators

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (Week 7)
- Enhanced multi-module support
- CI/CD integration
- GitHub Actions

### Phase 5: Migration & Documentation (Week 8)
- Migration tools and wizard
- Comprehensive documentation
- Example projects

### Phase 6: Testing & Quality (Ongoing)
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Performance optimization
- Security review

## Quick Start for Implementation

To begin implementing the refactoring:

1. **Start with Quick Wins** (can be done in parallel):
   - Task renaming (TASK-2.4, TASK-2.5)
   - Error message improvements (TASK-3.4, TASK-3.5)
   - Progress indicators (TASK-3.6)

2. **Follow the Critical Path** for core features:
   - Configuration Model → Configuration Sources → New DSL → Setup Wizard

3. **Maintain Backward Compatibility**:
   - Use feature flags for new behavior
   - Provide deprecation warnings
   - Include migration tools

## Success Metrics

- [ ] New user can publish in < 5 minutes
- [ ] Configuration reduced by 80% for standard cases
- [ ] Support tickets reduced by 50%
- [ ] 90% user satisfaction with new configuration

## Example: New Configuration

### Minimal Setup (After Refactoring)
```kotlin
// build.gradle.kts
plugins {
    id("com.tddworks.central-publisher") version "1.0.0"
}

centralPublisher {
    // Everything auto-detected!
}
```

### With Customization
```kotlin
centralPublisher {
    credentials {
        // Auto-loads from env vars or gradle.properties
    }
    
    projectInfo {
        // Auto-populated from git, can override
        description = "My awesome library"
    }
    
    publishing {
        autoPublish = true
        dryRun = false
    }
}
```

## Next Steps

1. Review and approve the PRD
2. Prioritize user stories
3. Assign tasks to team members
4. Set up tracking and metrics
5. Begin Phase 1 implementation
