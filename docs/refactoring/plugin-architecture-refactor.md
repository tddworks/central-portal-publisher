# Plugin Architecture Refactoring - Developer Mental Model

## Overview
Refactor the monolithic `CentralPublisherPlugin` to match developer mental models while preserving our strong existing architecture.

## Current Problems
1. **Cognitive Overload**: 414-line `apply()` method mixing all concerns
2. **Unclear Flow**: Developer can't predict what happens when
3. **Mixed Responsibilities**: Setup + configuration + validation + tasks all together
4. **Poor Developer Experience**: Complex mental model required

## Goal
Transform to developer-friendly approach:
- **Apply Plugin**: Simple, obvious setup
- **Configure**: Clear, type-safe DSL
- **Run Tasks**: Predictable behavior with good error messages

## Task Breakdown

### Phase 1: Core Architecture Extraction
- [x] **Task 1.1**: Create `CentralPublisherConfigurationManager` (TDD) ✅
  - Extract configuration resolution logic from main plugin
  - Handle auto-detection, validation, configuration merging
  - Test coverage: configuration scenarios, validation cases (6 tests, 100% pass rate)

- [x] **Task 1.2**: Create `CentralPublisherTaskManager` (TDD) ✅
  - Extract all task creation logic from main plugin
  - Handle task dependencies and lifecycle
  - Test coverage: task creation, dependencies, execution (6 tests, 100% pass rate)

- [x] **Task 1.3**: Create `CentralPublisherPublicationManager` (TDD) ✅
  - Extract publication configuration logic from main plugin  
  - Leverage existing strategy pattern architecture
  - Test coverage: publication setup, strategy selection (7 tests, 100% pass rate)

### Phase 2: Simplified Plugin Structure
- [x] **Task 2.1**: Simplify `CentralPublisherPlugin.apply()` method (TDD) ✅
  - Reduce to core responsibilities only (10 lines - under 20 line target!)
  - Move complex logic to afterEvaluate phase
  - Test coverage: plugin application, extension registration (7 tests, 100% pass rate)

- [x] **Task 2.2**: Implement developer-friendly flow (TDD) ✅
  - Clear separation: setup → configure → execute
  - Better error messages with actionable guidance
  - Test coverage: flow scenarios, error handling (integrated in Task 2.1)

### Phase 3: Integration & Compatibility
- [x] **Task 3.1**: Ensure backward compatibility (TDD) ✅
  - All existing DSL features work unchanged
  - All existing tasks work unchanged  
  - Test coverage: 11 integration tests pass, 75+ unit tests pass

- [x] **Task 3.2**: Improve developer experience (TDD) ✅
  - Better task descriptions with emojis and helpful explanations
  - Clearer error messages with actionable next steps  
  - Enhanced logging with mental model alignment
  - Test coverage: all tests updated to match improved UX

### Phase 4: Documentation & Examples
- [ ] **Task 4.1**: Update documentation
  - Reflect new mental model in docs
  - Update examples to show simplified approach
  - Add troubleshooting guide

## Success Criteria
1. ✅ Plugin `apply()` method < 20 lines → **ACHIEVED: 10 lines!**
2. ✅ All existing tests pass → **ACHIEVED: 11 integration tests + 75+ unit tests pass**
3. ✅ Clear separation of concerns → **ACHIEVED: 3 focused managers**
4. ✅ Better error messages → **ACHIEVED: Emoji-enhanced, actionable guidance**
5. ✅ Maintains all existing functionality → **ACHIEVED: Full backward compatibility**

## Implementation Notes
- Use TDD approach: write tests first, implement to pass
- Preserve existing strong architecture (DSL, validation, strategies)
- Focus on developer experience and mental model clarity
- Maintain backward compatibility throughout
